# ReelRecs Organization

Welcome to the ReelRecs, a comprehensive movie recommendation system designed to provide personalized and popularity-based movie suggestions. This project is my solo endeavor, built using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to enhance movie discovery for users.

## Repositories
